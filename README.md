# Machine-learning-Models-From-Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Linear Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These algorithms have been applied to different datasets such as the Heart Disease dataset, MNIST dataset, and Iris dataset.

For  Heart Disease dataset :  implement logistic regression to classify the presence of heart disease

For MNIST dataset :  implement neural network to classify handwritten digits 

For Iris dataset :  implement K-Nearest Neighbors and linear regression to classify the Iris flower species.


#Results

The results of the models on the respective datasets are as follows:

Logistic Regression

Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 85% on the Heart Disease dataset.
Precision: 0.87
Recall: 0.83
F1-Score: 0.85

Neural Network
Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 94% on the MNIST test set.

Linear Regression
Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 100% on the Iris test set for binary classification.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 96% on the Iris test set.
